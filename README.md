# kylecorp-team

A leadership team for AI-assisted software development, built on [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).

## What This Is

Most people use AI by giving it a task and getting a result back. Write this function. Fix this bug. One prompt, one response, one perspective.

This system works differently. Instead of a single AI that does whatever you ask, it's structured as a **leadership team** — five department heads who each own a specific discipline, have their own priorities, and can disagree with each other. It also includes **workflow skills** that automate common multi-step tasks like deploying to TestFlight.

The **Head of Design** cares about whether it looks and feels right. The **Head of Product** cares about whether we're building the right thing. The **CTO** cares about whether it's built well. The **CMO** cares about whether anyone will ever find it. **Legal/Finance** shows up when you need them and stays quiet when you don't.

Each head maintains a **source-of-truth document** they review before speaking — product requirements, architecture decisions, design principles. They don't start from scratch every conversation. They read what the team already decided and evaluate against it. This gives the organization memory.

Each head also carries **nested specializations** that only activate when relevant. The CTO can go deep on security, DevOps, or performance. The Design head can shift into accessibility auditing, brand consistency, or spatial design for Vision Pro. The CMO knows platform-specific tactics for TikTok, Reddit, or the App Store. The system stays lean by default but goes deep on demand.

The shift is subtle but fundamental: instead of managing tasks, you're **managing a team**. The AI isn't waiting for instructions — it's telling you what you need to hear from five different angles. It's the difference between having a tool and having a team.

## The Team

### Department Heads

| Skill | Role | Owns | Specializations |
|-------|------|------|-----------------|
| `/designboss` | Head of Design | `design.md` | `a11y`, `brand`, `whimsy`, `spatial` |
| `/productguy` | Head of Product | `PRD.md` | `priorities`, `trends`, `feedback`, `experiment` |
| `/CTO` | CTO / Engineering | `architecture.md` | `security`, `devops`, `performance`, `spatial` |
| `/CMO` | Head of Marketing | `marketing.md` | `aso`, `platforms` (5 channels), `image-prompts` |
| `/suits` | Legal / Finance / Ops | — | `compliance`, `finance`, `analytics`, `exec-summary` |

### Research & Coordination

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/focusgroup` | UX researcher — thinks like users, finds friction, routes findings to department heads |
| `/conferencecall` | Cross-functional debate — any combination of heads argue tradeoffs and deliver consensus |
| `/allhands` | Quick standup — every head gives 2-3 sentence status + flags (no deep debate) |

### Workflow Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/kickoff` | Project orientation — initializes foundation docs and gets the team started |
| `/testflight` | iOS deployment — takes any iOS app from source code to TestFlight with zero configuration |

## How to Use Each Skill

### Bring in one head to work a problem

```
/CTO security          → Deep security audit with STRIDE threat modeling
/designboss whimsy     → Evaluate personality and delight (includes microcopy library)
/productguy priorities → What should we build next, ranked by user value
/CMO aso               → App Store Optimization deep dive
/suits compliance      → GDPR/CCPA regulatory risk assessment
```

Each head stays in character — grounded in their discipline, opinionated, specific. They all accept optional input to focus their review on a specific area or question.

### Conference call — cross-functional debate

```
/conferencecall                          → Default trio: Design, Product, CTO
/conferencecall should we add offline    → Focused topic with default trio
/conferencecall CMO designboss           → Just those two
/conferencecall all                      → Everyone including /suits
```

The CTO argues it's a six-week architectural lift. Product says the target user needs it. Design worries about the sync conflict UX. They surface real tensions, argue honestly, and deliver a recommendation that acknowledges what's being sacrificed.

### All-hands standup

```
/allhands              → Quick pulse from Design, Product, CTO, CMO
/allhands [topic]      → Each head's quick take on a specific topic
```

Brief 2-3 sentence updates per head, plus cross-cutting flags. If something catches your eye, ask them to expand or pull a subset into `/conferencecall`.

### Focus group — the user's voice

```
/focusgroup                    → Holistic UX evaluation
/focusgroup onboarding flow    → Focused on a specific area
```

Thinks like your users, asks probing questions, then routes findings to the relevant department heads.

### Suits — when you need them

```
/suits compliance      → GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA regulatory audit
/suits finance         → NPV, ROI, cash flow analysis
/suits analytics       → Customer segmentation, attribution modeling
/suits exec-summary    → Consultant-grade 325-475 word executive briefing
```

Deliberately excluded from `/allhands` and `/conferencecall` unless explicitly invited. Just like in a real company, you don't want legal in every meeting — it changes the conversation.

### TestFlight — iOS deployment

```
/testflight            → Build and deploy the current project to TestFlight
```

Or just say "put this on testflight." The skill handles the entire pipeline:

1. Detects the Xcode project and scheme
2. Creates the app in App Store Connect if it doesn't exist (via EAS)
3. Bumps the build number
4. Archives and signs with `xcodebuild`
5. Exports the IPA
6. Uploads to TestFlight via `eas submit`

Works over SSH — no GUI required. See [TestFlight Setup](#testflight-setup) below for one-time machine configuration.

## Architecture

### Source-of-Truth Documents

Each project maintains documents that the team reads before speaking:

| Document | Owner | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `PRD.md` | Product | What, why, for whom, success criteria |
| `architecture.md` | CTO | System design, structure, key technical decisions |
| `design.md` | Design | Visual language, interaction patterns, HIG compliance |
| `marketing.md` | CMO | Positioning, channels, growth, go-to-market |
| `TODO.md` | Shared | Running list of issues found along the way |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Shared | Date-based log of what changed and why |

### Progressive Context Loading

Reference files only enter the AI's context window when relevant:

```

Heads auto-detect when to load specializations (CTO sees RealityKit imports → loads spatial reference) but you can also force a lens explicitly (`/CTO security`).

### File Inheritance

User-level defaults that project-level files inherit from and extend:

| User-level (defaults) | Project-level (specializes) |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `./CLAUDE.md` |
| `~/.claude/design.md` | `./design.md` |

User-level files contain universal preferences. Project-level files add project-specific decisions and can override when needed.

## Setup

### Install the team

```bash
# Clone into your Claude Code config directory
gh repo clone <your-username>/kylecorp-team ~/.claude
```

This gives you all department heads, workflow skills, design defaults, and keybindings immediately.

### What's included

| File / Directory | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Global instructions — workflow preferences, commit style, project structure |
| `design.md` | Default design system (Apple HIG principles, typography, spacing) |
| `skills/` | All department head skills and reference files |
| `settings.json` | Claude Code settings (model, plugins, hooks) |
| `keybindings.json` | Custom keyboard shortcuts |

### What you'll need to customize

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Review and adjust workflow preferences to match how you work
- **`design.md`** — Replace the default design system with your own if you don't follow Apple HIG
- **`settings.json`** — Update hooks (the stop-notification hook sends iMessages — remove or reconfigure)

---

## TestFlight Setup

The `/testflight` skill requires one-time machine setup to build and deploy iOS apps headlessly.

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode installed
- An Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- Node.js (for EAS CLI)

### 1. App Store Connect API Key

1. Go to [App Store Connect > Integrations > API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api)
2. Generate an API key (requires Admin role)
3. Note the **Key ID**, **Issuer ID**, and your **Team ID**
4. Download the `.p8` file and save it:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys
mv ~/Downloads/AuthKey_XXXXXXXX.p8 ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/
```

### 2. Signing Certificates in System Keychain

Signing certs must be in the **System keychain** (not login keychain) so they're accessible from SSH sessions. On macOS 15+, the login keychain is only available in GUI sessions.

Create Distribution + Development certificates (via Xcode or the ASC API), export as `.p12`, then import:
```bash
sudo security import dist.p12 -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain -P "export-password" -A -T /usr/bin/codesign -T /usr/bin/security
sudo security import dev.p12 -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain -P "export-password" -A -T /usr/bin/codesign -T /usr/bin/security
```

Verify: `security find-identity -v -p codesigning /Library/Keychains/System.keychain`

### 3. EAS CLI

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
```

EAS is needed because Apple's API doesn't support creating new app records — EAS handles this using Apple ID credentials.

### 4. Apple ID Credentials

Store your Apple ID securely in the System keychain:
```bash
sudo security add-generic-password -a 'your@email.com' -s 'EXPO_APPLE_ID' -w 'your@email.com' /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
sudo security add-generic-password -a 'your@email.com' -s 'EXPO_APPLE_PASSWORD' -w 'your-apple-id-password' /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

Load them into environment variables at shell startup — add to `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export EXPO_APPLE_ID=$(security find-generic-password -s 'EXPO_APPLE_ID' -w /Library/Keychains/System.keychain 2>/dev/null)
export EXPO_APPLE_PASSWORD=$(security find-generic-password -s 'EXPO_APPLE_PASSWORD' -w /Library/Keychains/System.keychain 2>/dev/null)
```

### 5. Configure the Skill

Edit `~/.claude/skills/testflight/SKILL.md` and replace the placeholder values:
- `$ASC_API_KEY_ID` → your API Key ID
- `$ASC_API_KEY_ISSUER_ID` → your Issuer ID
- `$APPLE_TEAM_ID` → your Team ID
- `$APPLE_ID` → your Apple ID email

### Verify

From any iOS project:
```bash
# Pre-flight checks
security find-identity -v -p codesigning /Library/Keychains/System.keychain  # Should show 2+ identities
eas whoami                                                                     # Should show your account
test -f ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/AuthKey_*.p8 && echo "API key OK"     # Should print OK
```

Then just say "put this on testflight" and the skill handles everything.

## Lineage

Inspired by [agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) (61 standalone AI agent personas). This system absorbs ~35 of those agents' capabilities but takes a different architectural approach: fewer heads with depth via progressive-loading reference files, organized like a real leadership team rather than a roster of specialists.
